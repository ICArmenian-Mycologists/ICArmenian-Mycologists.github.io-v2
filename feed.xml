<p>On February 7th, 2021 ICAM made contact with Armenia. Specifically an individual, Dr. Arsen Gasparyan, who is a classically trained/educated lichenologist.
He completed his Ph.D. in Berlin Germany on Lichen Diversity in Armenia.</p>

<p>ICAM was very excited to meet and discuss our common goals and plans.</p>

<p>We first listened to Arsen and the educational disparity he is currently facing due to post-soviet crumbling educational infrastructure. 
He described how the war has impacted not only his personal life, but also the entire Armenian community as a whole. 
He emphasized there is so much uncertainty and sorrow in our people especially after the 44 days of war.</p>

<p>We discussed our future plans like workshops, mentorship opportunities and funding directions!
Dr. Arsen also has different organizational groups he has created and maintained - specifically the Lichens of Armenia <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LichensofArmenia">FB page</a> and <a href="http://lichenology.am">website</a>.
He is currently working with a couple of Armenian students, ICAM is excited to meet them our next meeting!
More to come - Stay tuned!</p>

<p>November 14, 2020.
As soon as the war ended between Azerbaijan and Armenia Claudia, Patty and Tania were discussing how to help their war torned country. Tania knew Arik from her Microbiology program and thus started the ICAM journey. Our first meeting was November 14th, we met through zoom and discussed our thoughts, frustrations and ideas about what an organizational effort would look like.</p>

<p>We met up every week after that to discuss and plan different points we want to address.</p>]]></content><author><name>Tania Kurbessoian</name></author><category term="ICAM" /><category term="Armenia" /><category term="Mycology" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
